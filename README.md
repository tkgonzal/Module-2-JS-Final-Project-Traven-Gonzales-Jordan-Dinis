# Pathfinder 2e Encounter Calculator
An app used to calculate possible encounters for the user to be used in PF2e. Created using the [rules for encounter building in PF2e](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=497) and a greedy implementation of the general solution to the [Change Making problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem). Made with React and Vanilla JS.

## Usage Instructions
